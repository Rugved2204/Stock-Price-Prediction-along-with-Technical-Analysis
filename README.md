# Stock-Price-Prediction-along-with-Technical-Analysis

In this project I have created a model for prediciting Stock Market Price for Nifty Bank. I have used LSTM(Long Short term Memory) as they work better for sequencial data as well as time series data and overcomes problems such vanishing gradient problem. 
Extracted data from Yahoo Finance. Processed the data by scaling it and cleaning it by removing null values.
I also incorporated Technical Indicators such as MA(moving Average), EMA(Exponential Moving Average) MACD(Moving Average Convergence Divergence), Bollinger Bands for analysisng the stock prices. We can make this project better by adding new features such as income and financial statements, sentiment analysis of tweets.
